# InkBox OS telemetry framework

If an user agrees to send their device information to the InkBox OS project's developers, the following is what will be transmitted to them:
- Device's UID
- InkBox OS version
- Device model
- Whether or not the device is running on a rooted kernel
- Whether or not a developer key is installed
